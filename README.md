# Scanner Humidity Plot
A MATLAB function that can read and plot a Philips MRI humidity log file. 

Copy the log file from the scanner (e.g. from `G:\monitoring\monitor_System_HumExamRoom.dat` ).

In MATLAB, type `readMonitoring` and select the file.

The MATLAB Data tip can be used to read off specific values.
Note the measurements are often taken out of working hours.
